# Java RSS Reader

This is a simple Java application that allows users to manage and view updates from their favorite RSS feeds.

## Features

- Add a new RSS feed URL
- Delete an existing RSS feed URL
- View updates from selected RSS feeds

## Usage

The application presents a menu with four options:

1. Show updates: This option allows you to view updates from your selected RSS feeds. You can choose to view updates from all feeds or select a specific one.
2. Add URL: This option allows you to add a new RSS feed URL to your list.
3. Delete URL: This option allows you to delete an existing RSS feed URL from your list.
4. Exit: This option allows you to exit the application. By selecting this option, the application will write the current state of your RSS feeds to a file(data.txt). This allows the application to restore your previous settings the next time it runs.
